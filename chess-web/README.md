## Analysis Features in Detail

### Move Quality Classification
The system evaluates each move by comparing the played move with Stockfish's best recommendation:

- **Centipawn Loss**: Difference between best and played move evaluations
- **Brilliant Moves**: Tactical gains ‚â•300cp that the player found
- **Classification**: Based on Chess.com's proven quality thresholds

### Accuracy Calculation
Uses the industry-standard Chess.com accuracy formula:
- Caps centipawn loss at 600 to prevent single blunders from dominating
- Normalizes across all moves for fair comparison
- Provides percentage rating (0-100%)

### Phase Analysis
Games are divided into three phases:
- **Opening**: Moves 1-20
- **Middlegame**: Moves 21-60  
- **Endgame**: Moves 61+

Each phase gets separate accuracy calculation and performance rating.
